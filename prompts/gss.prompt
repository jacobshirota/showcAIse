The project was built using the Godot game engine as a capstone project for Jacob's Software Engineering class.
Jacob worked as the Project Manager over a team of four developers. As Project Manager, he was responsible for the successful on-time delivery of development artifacts, scheduling of milestones, and overseeing the integration of components from the entire team.
As a developer, Jacob was primarily responsible for menu screens, database integration, and quality assurance.
